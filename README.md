## RNS-E CarPC


## Overview

rnsecarpc will provide some useful scripts and howtos to turn your Audi RNS-E navigation system into a recent media engine.
The heart of the environment will be a Raspberry Pi using a PiCan2 board to interact with the CAN-bus of the RNS-E unit.
That way you will be able to control Kodi directly via the RNS-E knobs, so that no additional input device is required.

Kodi will be used as the main interface and some python scripts will run in the background to read and write to the CAN bus.


## Features

- Control Kodi via RNS-E
- Dedicated RNS-E skin for Kodi
- Display useful car telemetry taken from CAN bus
